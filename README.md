# Multi-controlled-U-gate
This repo contains a Jupyter notebook where I define (in qiskit) the function nCU_circuit(U,n), which takes an arbitrary 2x2 unitary matrix $U$ and a positive integer $n$ as input, and then outputs the circuit for the multi-controlled $C^nU$ gate. In my construction, I use only 1-qubit gates and $CX$ gates, building $C^nU$ from scratch. The details of the instruction are outlined in the Jupyter notebook and based off section 4.3 of Quantum Computation and Quantum Information by Nielsen & Chuang.
