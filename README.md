# Multi-controlled-U-gate
In this repo I define the function $nCU_circuit(U,n)$ which takes an arbitrary 2x2 unitary matrix $U$ and a positive integer $n$ as input, and outputs the circuit for the multi-controlled $C^nU$ gate. In my construction, I only use 1-qubit gates and $CX$ gates, building $C^nU$ from scratch.
